Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">

The arbitrator will decide in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in The United States of America, Massachusetts.
